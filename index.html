                <p class="s-2-h2">Why a walkable suburb?</p>
                <p class="s-2-pg-1">Suburban areas are heavily popular due to their cheapness and ability to accommodate large families. However, suburban areas often require a car, and almost all errands can not be accomplished by foot. </p>

                <p class="s-3-h2">How I'm approaching walkability</p>
                <p class="s-3-pg-1">Many suburban areas in North America are already capable of being walkable areas. Upgrades that can make this happen are:
                    <ul class="s-3-ul">
                        <li>Adding Bus Routes or Tram Lines</li>
                        <li>Making businesses and amenities within closer distances</li>
                        <li>Maintaining a good ratio of commercial buildings and residential buildings in a given area</li>
                        <li>Using the Grid System</li>
                    </ul>
